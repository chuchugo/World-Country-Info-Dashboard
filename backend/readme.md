## Project name: Full-stack Developer Technical Case
Total time allotted to submit: 5 hours
** Please note that any modifications to the project after the time limit are grounds for the entire case being rejected **


## Set-up instructions for the project
1. **Important : ** Fork both repl tabs (top menu button). Notice that your project URL's will change after forking from the URL's that were shared with you
2. Refresh both browser tabs after forking
3. Run the Node.js back-end application (top menu button) and **wait** until the connection is stabilized
4. Replace the constant API_URL in script.js file with your API URL (printed on the right window at the top) of your back-end application. Make sure you end this URL with a '/'
5. Add your full name in the <title/> tag of index.html i.e. 	<title>Author full name: </title>
6. Refresh this server after making any changes on the back-end


## Back-end Challenges
1. **(20pts)** Write an async http request method to fetch the data for countries having the keyword "United" as part of their name using the REST Countries API found at https://restcountries.eu/
2. **(15pts)** Fix the method **insertCountry** by iterating through the API data and inserting it into the countries table that is already created for you in db.js


## Front-end Challenges
1. **(10pts)** Write a function to query the required data as seen in the website design document from countries table
2. **(10pts)** Render the retrieved data in a tabular form as seen in the design document
3. **(20pts)** Use any JavaScript visualization library of your choice (for example - Highcharts, D3 etc) to display a bar chart of population by country 
4. **(10pts)** Style the front-end application to look like the design document

## Full-stack Challenge
1. **(15pts)** Calculate the population density for each country and display it in a tabular form. Population density is calculated as population / area

## Instructions for submitting the project within the 5-hour time limit
1. Email your forked repl URL's (both front-end and back-end applications) by copying from your browser address bars to kkunnur@deloitte.com
2. ** Optional ** - Attach any additional document to the email (if required) to explain your project
